<h2><A name="name">Project or product name</A></h2>Your project’s/product's name is the first thing people will see upon scrolling down to the README

<h2><A name="installation">Installation</a></h2>Tell other users how to install the project/product locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

<h2><A name="usage">Usage</a></h2>Instruct others on how to use the project/product after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of the project/product in action.

<h2><A name="contributors">Contributors</a></h2> Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If there are specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to the work.
